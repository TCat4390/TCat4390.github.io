Bridge ‚Äî Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 2025-10-22
Last Updated: 2025-10-22

Thank you for using Bridge (the ‚ÄúApp‚Äù).
This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use the App, currently distributed for testing and limited public use.

Bridge is built with privacy-first principles: we do not run advertisements, do not sell personal data, and minimize all forms of storage.

‚∏ª

1. Overview

Bridge enables on-device and cloud-assisted translation of voice, photos, and text.
We process limited data only as necessary to deliver these functions, and we delete or anonymize it once no longer needed.

‚∏ª

2. Data We Handle

Voice and Audio

When you use voice translation:
	‚Ä¢	The App records short audio segments while you hold or tap the record button.
	‚Ä¢	These recordings are securely transmitted to our relay service, which forwards them to a trusted speech recognition provider to convert speech into text, then returns the result.
	‚Ä¢	The relay service does not store or log audio content.
	‚Ä¢	Temporary files on your device are deleted right after conversion.
	‚Ä¢	The external provider may retain limited data for a short period in accordance with its own policy; we configure our systems to minimize such retention.

Photos

When you use photo translation or description:
	‚Ä¢	Images are captured through the App‚Äôs built-in camera.
	‚Ä¢	All location (EXIF/GPS) and device metadata are removed automatically before upload.
	‚Ä¢	The processed image is transmitted securely to our relay service, which forwards it to a language-processing provider for interpretation and then returns the result.
	‚Ä¢	The relay service does not persist or log image data.
	‚Ä¢	A copy of the photo and its result may remain in your local history until you delete it.

Text and History
	‚Ä¢	Your input text, translations, and previous results are stored only on your device inside protected local storage.
	‚Ä¢	Bridge does not automatically upload or share these records with our servers or third parties.
	‚Ä¢	If you sign in, we store a hashed account identifier and authentication tokens for secure session management.

Device & Diagnostic Data
	‚Ä¢	We collect minimal technical data (device type, system version, language, time zone) required to ensure compatibility and detect abuse.
	‚Ä¢	Network information such as IP addresses is handled transiently by our infrastructure provider for routing and security, not by Bridge itself.
	‚Ä¢	We do not use analytics, advertising identifiers, or behavior tracking SDKs.

Payment & Credits
	‚Ä¢	If you purchase translation credits or subscriptions, payment processing is handled entirely by Apple through In-App Purchase.
	‚Ä¢	We record transaction references, anonymized account identifiers, and credit balances to operate the service.
	‚Ä¢	We never store card numbers or billing details.
	‚Ä¢	Transaction records are retained up to five years for accounting and fraud prevention.

‚∏ª

3. Why We Process Data

We process information solely for:
	1.	Delivering translations, transcriptions, and photo explanations.
	2.	Operating user accounts, credits, and subscriptions.
	3.	Protecting our systems from abuse and maintaining service reliability.
	4.	Meeting legal and accounting obligations.

We never use your data for model training or targeted marketing.

4. How Data Is Stored and Retained

Type	Storage Location	Retention
Audio & photo content	In-memory transit only	Deleted immediately after processing
Text & history	On your device (encrypted)	Until you delete it
Account / credits	Encrypted database (minimal fields)	Up to 5 years
Access tokens	Secure system keychain	Rotated or invalidated within 30 days
Logs	Operational, non-content metrics only	Short-term, aggregated


‚∏ª

5. Security Measures

We employ:
	‚Ä¢	End-to-end HTTPS/TLS encryption for all transmissions.
	‚Ä¢	OS-level encryption for on-device storage.
	‚Ä¢	Encrypted secrets and keys with scheduled rotation.
	‚Ä¢	Strict access control (only two authorized engineers).
	‚Ä¢	Rate limits and validation to prevent automated abuse.
	‚Ä¢	A security response plan for timely notification in case of any breach.

‚∏ª

6. Third-Party Services

Bridge uses a small number of infrastructure and AI service providers:
	‚Ä¢	Cloud infrastructure provider (for secure request relaying and database storage).
	‚Ä¢	Speech recognition provider (for converting audio to text).
	‚Ä¢	Language model provider (for generating translations and explanations).
	‚Ä¢	Apple (for authentication and payment processing).

Each provider processes data under its own privacy policy and may temporarily store data as described in their documentation.
We configure available options to disable logging and training wherever possible, but cannot fully control their internal practices.
By using features that require these services, you consent to such processing.

‚∏ª

7. International Transfers

Data may be routed through servers located in different countries to ensure global performance.
We rely on standard contractual safeguards or equivalent protection for such transfers when required by law.

‚∏ª

8. Your Rights and Choices
	‚Ä¢	Delete locally: You may delete individual or all conversations and photos within the App.
	‚Ä¢	Delete account: Selecting Delete Account removes your account and credit data from our database.
	‚Ä¢	Data requests: Contact us to access or delete remaining records.
	‚Ä¢	Third-party data: Requests relating to external AI providers will be forwarded where feasible, but we cannot guarantee their deletion schedules.
	‚Ä¢	Opt-out: We do not sell or share your personal information for advertising.

‚∏ª

9. Children‚Äôs Privacy

We do not knowingly collect data from children.
